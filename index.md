## Personal Story

My name is Joanne Rigterink. I am a passionate 3D artist specializing in environment art but not shy of doing other 3D or even 2D art if the task requires it. I love learning new things and strive to improve every day. 

outside my work I also dedicate a large amount of time to art, or socialize with others. I also love diving or cycling when I get the chance. 
I got my first experience in 3D modeling in 2016. I ended up in an unintended hallway at an open day at the HKU and was immediately sold on the study of game art, 3D in particular. We had an introductory lesson on Maya. That same day I had installed Blender and bought my very first drawing tablet (a huge but old professional Wacom Intuos 3). 

It took me 2 years before I was good enough to actually enjoy it, but since then I've learned much. After doing a study in game art at the Noorderpoort in Groningen, doing an internship at Vasco where I worked on titles such as ships of battle: age of pirates and ships of battle: Pacific. Later I rolled into game design at the Hanze. 
I joined Beyond Skyrim in 2019, and for some reason they accepted my application. I wasn’t ready yet when I send that application. But after months of waiting and little progress I figured I would probably perform better in an actual team of experienced members.

That same year I enrolled in a course for game design at the Hanze, hoping I’ll one day understand the basics of game design and programming as well, whilst continuing to work on my 3D skills with Beyond Skyrim and other personal projects.
